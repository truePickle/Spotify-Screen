# Spotify-Screen
A small screen that shows Information about the Song that is currently Playing. An ESP32 connected to a Display shows the information it gets from a server which communicates with the Spotify API. The Server also gathers and stors some data for Statistics. This is a Project for my IOT Lecture.
